### Hello, I'm Valdez!
Dedicated to advancing as a Cloud DevOps Engineer, I am actively pursuing the AWS Developer Associates Certification to complement my ongoing studies. I successfully completed the AWS Restart Bootcamp with BrookSource, attaining the Cloud Practitioner Foundation Certification from AWS. My practical experience extends to the exploration of diverse AWS services, including CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda, and serverless architecture. Future endeavors include honing skills in Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD Pipeline tools.

In conjunction with my technical proficiency, I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Fine Arts from Wilberforce University, with a specialized focus on graphic design. Augmenting my creative background, I am certified in Google Ad Search and Digital Advertising from CourseCareers. My comprehensive understanding of various software applications, fundamental IT concepts, and Cloud infrastructure fuels my enthusiasm to further elevate my skills in the realm of Cloud technology.

With over a decade of experience, I utilized my graphic art expertise to craft designs for Reunion Planners in the Metro Detroit area. Simultaneously, I strategically applied my digital marketing skills to effectively promote my business services to this targeted demographic. My unique blend of technical and creative capabilities positions me as a dynamic professional ready to contribute to the intersection of Cloud DevOps and innovative problem-solving.
